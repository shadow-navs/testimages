Straight Through vs Manual 

This is what I had analysed. 

Once the batch starts for the subsequent journey, 

- It picks records having status - PENDING, IN_PROGRESS and SUBMITTED from RETIREMENT_APPLICATION table with specific parameters for each status. 

- For each record, it will get the Drawdown Handler based on the status.

- If it is SUBMITTED status,
	* Then based on date submitteed and other parameters, the status will be changed to COMPLETED

- If it is PENDING status,
	* Here it checks whether to go for STRAIGHT THROUGH or MANUAL (stream demand to be picked up by CSR team)
	
- Checks to decide for STRAIGHT THROUGH. All the below conditions should be satisfied.

	* Has NO financial crime CK warning on the plan 
	* Has NO REGULAR income
	* Should NOT be fully encashing
	* Should NOT have any TFC on entering journey
	* Checks if agency code is EQUAL TO default agency code: 5/5999
	* If customer has been PAID any prior "IrregularIncome" payments (Irregular one-off payments)

- If any of the above conditions fail, it goes to MANUAL flow.
